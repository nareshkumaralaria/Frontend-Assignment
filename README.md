# UI-JSON-Schema

This is a simple React application that allows users to paste a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application has a single screen that is divided into two equal sections next to each other. The left section contains a JSON editor for pasting the UI schema, and the right section automatically renders the form based on the pasted UI schema.
